            Try something active outside- a walk/run, ice skating on Occom, cross-country skiingStand instead 
            of sitting when doing work. Try a different random act of kindness each day. Add at least one 
            vegetable or fruit to every meal. Limit the number of alcoholic beverages you consume- either count 
            your drinks or set a drink limit. Do something kind for a friend each day- leave a note of encouragement 
            for your roommate, bring a treat to your friend in the library, write a letter to an old friend.</p>

        Is a healthier lifestyle something that you want? If so, what’s stopping you? For many of us, 
        the idea of a complete and total overhaul can be overwhelming. The best way to go transition 
        to a healthier lifestyle is to focus on one step—or in this case task—at a time. We designed 
        our healthy tasks challenge with this in mind. You will have one simple task to complete each 
        day. Each task is designed to improve your health in one way or another, be it physically, 
        mentally, emotionally, or a combination of the three. There is a little twist, though, but 
        we’ll address that in a moment!

        The rules are very simple: Read the task for the day you’re on and complete it 
        before the day is over. Some tasks will be more detailed than others, so feel 
        free to look ahead and plan accordingly. Here’s the twist: You can’t skip a task. 
        You must complete each one! If you skip one or don’t complete it fully, you 
        have to start back at day one. <br><br>
        Only you will know whether or not you completed a task for the day. No one is 
        keeping track of you. This challenge is 100% based on the honor system. That said, 
        we highly recommend grabbing an accountability partner to do this challenge with. 
        Having someone to answer to is a fantastic way to ensure adherence!
